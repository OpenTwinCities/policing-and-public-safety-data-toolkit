## Ideas for Hack to Give Thanks (Nov 21, 2020)

**Research:**
 - Improve the data source references:  
   + Add other states (references > data_sources > your_state.md)  
   + Independent / non-governmental data sources (references > data_sources > non_governmental.md)  
 - Improve tutorial on “How to make a data request”  
   + Add example data request language  
   + Legal research & resources on open data laws  

**Data analysis (notebooks):**  
 - Using one of the notebooks as a template, try to recreate the analysis using your own data.  
   + Does it work?  
   + Does the data dictionary make sense?  (If not, add improvements)  
   + Expand on it and share it back to the repo! (Do we want both notebooks and reports?)  
 - Create a new notebook template and data dictionary on a topic not already covered. Share it back to the repo (including an .HTML file in the reports/ folder).  
   + Use of force  
   + Police personnel records  
   + Hate crimes data  

**UI:**  
 - Improve the repository’s UI  
 - Need a nice interface to help people find:  
   1. reports  
   2. tutorials  
   3. data dictionaries  

**Other:**
 - Archiving data
   + Add a new tutorial on “How to archive data”  
   + After you’ve requested data, how do you store it responsibly?  

### GitHub plan for hackathon:  
1. We start with special hackathon branches:  
 - hackathon_research  
 - hackathon_data_analysis  
 - hackathon_ui  

2. Participants fork the branch they want to work on  
3. They submit a pull request to the branch in our main repository  
4. We merge at the end!
