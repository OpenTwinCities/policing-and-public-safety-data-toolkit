# Policing and Public Safety Data Toolkit  
## Project overview  
Inspired by projects like the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) and the [Center for Policing Equity](https://policingequity.org/) -- common approaches, shared vision of what data can look like, stronger when we can share language and concepts.  

In our initial conversations, we identified that there is a need to improve the pipeline for using data to promote important conversations. There are two specific “gaps” that this toolkit focuses on:  
**Gap:** Some places have data available, but limited data analysis capacity  
**→ Solution:** Example notebooks, aimed at brigade members and other volunteers, to act as templates for asking answering questions using this kind of data  
**Gap:** Some municipalities have limited data available  
**→ Solution:** Provide information on where to find data, the laws around public data, and how to make data requests  

Build literacy around this data among brigade members.  One primary audience of this work is Code for America Brigade members and other volunteers who want ideas for how to approach policing and public safety data in their communities.  We’re assuming with some basic background in data analysis (some Excel, familiarity with .CSV files, navigating open data). Our goal is to help civic technologists get up and running faster with some ways you can look at this data to deepen your own local conversations.  

We also want to acknowledge that data has power, and is imperfect. It never tells the whole story--but it can help us deepen the stories we tell, or identify stories that are missing.  

Goals:  
 - Elevate existing projects and efforts; avoid reproducing wherever possible.  
 - Use existing data to ask questions, notice patterns, and deepen public conversations.  
 - Explore both the problems in existing policing practices and new possibilities for promoting public safety.  

Out of current scope:  
 - Create a national clearinghouse of policing and public safety data  
 - Large-scale data collection effort  

## Ideas for hackathon:  

Research:  
 - Improve the data source references:  
   + Add other states (references > data_sources > your_state.md)  
   + Independent / non-governmental data sources (references > data_sources > non_governmental.md)  
 - Improve tutorial on “How to make a data request”  
   + Add example data request language  
   + Legal research & resources on open data laws  

Data analysis (notebooks):  
 - Using one of the notebooks as a template, try to recreate the analysis using your own data.  
   + Does it work?  
   + Does the data dictionary make sense?  (If not, add improvements)  
   + Expand on it and share it back to the repo! (Do we want both notebooks and reports?)  
 - Create a new notebook template and data dictionary on a topic not already covered. Share it back to the repo (including an .HTML file in the reports/ folder).  
   + Use of force  
   + Police personnel records  
   + Hate crimes data  

UI:  
 - Improve the repository’s UI  
 - Need a nice interface to help people find:  
   1. reports  
   1. tutorials  
   1. data dictionaries  
   
Other:  
 - Archiving data
   + Add a new tutorial on “How to archive data”  
   + After you’ve requested data, how do you store it responsibly?  

## GitHub plan for hackathon:  
We make special hackathon branches:  
 - hackathon_research  
 - hackathon_data_analysis  
 - hackathon_ui  
They fork the branch they want to work on  
They submit a pull request to the branch in our main repository  
We merge at the end!
