Only host data in this GitHub repository if absolutely necessary (for example, if data is not consistently maintained or runs the risk of disappearing at its original source location). Otherwise, reference the original source website in your notebook and show how the data can be obtained directly from the source.

Toolkit users can store raw data in the **local/** sub-folder under this directory when they're running example analyses locally. When running the example notebooks, you will generally want to download the example dataset(s) from the original source website(s) listed in the example, and then store the data files in this folder.  Everything in the **local/** sub-folder is set up to be ignored in the .gitignore file, so none of the files stored in this folder will be committed to GitHub.

*TODO: Work on a set of archival "best practices" for storing datasets.*  
*TODO: Create a tutorial to help civic technology teams get started with this.*
