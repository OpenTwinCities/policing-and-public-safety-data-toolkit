# Advocate for Good Data Practices
**There's a lot of disparity in data availability and quality. How can we champion better practices to empower better data collection and analysis on a broader (national) scale?**  

There are a number of national initiatives that are already doing great advocacy to make policing and public safety data more open, coordinated across systems, and usable.  Join their mailing lists, check out their resources, participate in their outreach!
