# Gather and Understand Existing Data  
**How do I find and make sense of what data already exists publicly?**  

## Overview of how law enforcement works in the U.S.  

Before you go and collect your own data, check and make sure it doesn't already exist somewhere.  To find data, it helps to understand the different levels of law enforcement in the U.S., since different agencies maintain different data.  
    *TODO research Federal, State, County, Municipal*
